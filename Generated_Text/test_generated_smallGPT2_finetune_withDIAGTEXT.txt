HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 59-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for type I diabetes mellitus and
hypercholesterolemia and a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed
secondary to an acute on chronic
colonoscopy with duodenoscopy on [**2165-11-22**].  She had been evaluated in
outpatient for risk factors for possible GI bleed due to a recent
colonoscopy.

Prior to the patient's admission, she had also been seen by the gastroenterology consult service and was
on the recommendation of the Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1557**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1558**] and had been followed
by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1559**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1560**].  She was continued on the lower GI

gastroenterology consult.
She had been seen by the GI fellow on [**Date Range **] for
[**2165-11-22**] which was found that the bleeding ulcer is
compatible with
bleeding ulcers as well as possible diverticulosis.  The GI fellow also noted that
her
her bleeding ulcers were well
dressed with some non-bleeding, however, was recommended a GI
consult from [**Date Range **] that she should be
admitted to [**Month/Day/Year 197**] for a follow-up.  Patient
refused admission.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 66-year-old
Caucasian female who was admitted on [**2103-2-5**] for congestive heart
failure/asthma exacerbation and hypercarbic respiratory failure exacerbation.  She was
found to be having acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as
interstitial lung disease and a question of
interstitial colitis.

She had been diuresed with Lasix in the hospital and had no pulmonary symptoms of dyspnea.
She did have a cough which later resolved.  She was admitted to the ICU for
further care.  Her blood
cultures, urine culture, chest x-ray and blood culture were drawn.
sent on [**2103-2-2-2**] and returned negative.  She was admitted for an elevated
lactic acidosis on [**2-2-7**], respiratory failure.  Her

diuretics were stopped and her creatinine increased
secondary to elevated blood
s.
secondary to pulmonary edema and hypoventilation.  Her cardiac enzymes remained
within normal limits.
(Baseline 0.66 and
Baseline 1.2).  Her respiratory status was thought to be most likely secondary
to
fluid overload
from fluid
exaclobulization during
cardiac catheterization given fluidex and
hypotension in the unit.  Her BUN was noted to be 8.2 on [**2103-2-2-8**] and she was in at that time
unclear
history of
fluid.  She was thought to have a large volume depletion secondary to
fluid
hypotension.  Her fluid regimen during the CXR and it was
improved with no further acidosis, so it was thought
to be due to fluids
in the unit.



At the time of admission her trach on [**2-9**] was noted to have a positive urinary tract infection.  Her trach was placed on
nebs to be negative
intravenous O2.  Her trach was positive.  On admission she was started on
cefazolin to treat her fluid
leukocytosis for which she received antibiotics and a sputum cx on
[**2103-2-10**] was
negative.  A repeat trach on [**2103-2-11**] grew pseudomonas on [**2-14**] was negative, which
is her source for the UTI so was treated with the
cefazolin.  She was also given a dose of vancomycin for empiric treatment
pneumoboots.  Her CXR was done on [**2-14**] thought to be pneumonia.  Her
fazolin was changed to cefazolin x 1 day and vancomycin x1 at rehab due to
possibility of
transaminitis in the setting of pneumonia.  On [**2-11**] she was afebrile and her sputum
cultures were
positive for coag negative Staph aureus.  All of her antibiotics were
discontinued.  All CXR was negative.  On [**2-13**] her Cr was 0.6.  Her sputum cx is also
negative as well.  On [**2-13**] her diarrhea was also c/w from urinary source (toxic)
which may be
from her pleural effusions.  At rehab, she was on zosyn and was treated with
ciprofloxacin for a few days.  She had some trouble with

and her Zosyn was stopped.  She was noted to be tachy<|endoftext|>

CHIEF COMPLAINT: This is a 69-year-old male with a past
medical history significant for coronary artery disease, hypertension,
status post myocardial infarction and stent placement at [**Hospital6 2105**],
status post bypass graft with a left atrioventricular pacemaker in [**2168**],
status post endocarditis and cholecystectomy in [**2150**]
who presented with a right upper lobe mass. The patient was found to be in respiratory distress
on [**2179-6-15**] and
diagnosed with a right lower lobe atelectasis and dyspnea. There was concern that this was secondary
to empyema.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old gentleman with a history of recurrent episodes of pneumocystis
with hematemesis and fever and hypoxia at an admission to the
[**Hospital6 2105**] for
this acute illness.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post
in [**2176**], status post left lower lobe
atrial
plasty, status post
and mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft
percutaneous
surgery.
Coronary angiography at that time was performed.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital1 346**] [**2179-6-17**]
complaining
of
left lower lobe mass.  His chest pain was associated with left lower lobe
and increased work of breathing and it was noted that he was
in chest pain
at rest the past 3-4minutes
and developed a sore throat and a right upper lobe
n pain.  that was
an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction
of 20% on the left upper
with antero-lobular
apueminal
gradient and was found to be
unresponsive and was transferred to
the Emergency
Medical Service. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization at that time which revealed a
an ejection fraction of 40% LAD
artery MI and an ejection fraction of 50% in the
60%
secondary
lesion fractional infarct. A chest x-ray was performed which was ruled out myocardial
infarction. The patient had been referred for
cardiac catheterization
surgery. Mr. [**Known lastname **] is status post a percutaneous coronary
pseudoaneurysm. Percutaneous coronary intervention with
coronary artery bypass grafts is performed on [**2179-7-15**].
This revealed a stent to be in the left anterior descending
and obtuse marginal, and a left anterior descending coronary artery. He underwent
coronary artery
bypass graft to OM2, and
coronary artery bypass surgery was complicated by Left below the knee
myocardial infarction with left
below the knee
myocardial infarction. He tolerated the operation well and received aspirin for the
procedure.
Mr. [**Known lastname 346**] [**Known lastname 346**] had no complaints. He remained in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for
anesthesia. An arterial line was placed, he was started
on CVVH with
a mean arterial pressure of 52/12 with a
dilated left atrium at 70. He had a dopplerable left
anterior
ventricular
pressure of 58/14. Echocardiogram demonstrated right ventricular
collateral and posterior
collateral hypokinesis with a right
anterior-posterior
diastolic pressure of 44/22 and a wedge pressure of 47/24. The
patient was
transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit on a heparin drip for post-op chest pain. The patient was

stable.  The patient was noted to be in acute on chronic sinus
brady syndrome at the time of his admission.  The patient was
continued to have
worsened respiratory
distress and was transferred back to the ICU in the setting of a question of fevers.
His sputum cx was negative as well so had a CTX and abx, which was
difficult to be given his

brady.  The patient was also given Zosyn
for a possible
infection of his pleural effusion which showed good pleural effusion.  He was
treated for
sepsis and with Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The patient also had mild
anemia of 2.4 L.  He was initially seen on the floor by neuro and found to
have left sided

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient was initially admitted
with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure and aortic stenosis,
secondary to congestive heart failure from bilateral pneumonia.  She
and her mother had a previous MI at age and presents with dyspnea of unclear
etiology.  She was found to have a chest
pain on cardiac catheterization on [**2187-1-7**].  This chest x-ray
revealed a right groin
pacer with a right lower lobe infiltrate that was
in the right upper lobe and no intervention was
performed and a right groin chest wall
myx-ultation.  Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 392**]
Surgery, was consulted and they performed
a right chest CT without
in the cath, but no intervention.  Patient's right groin
thickness was
concerning for a peritonitis.  She was admitted to the
hospital for right groin
pacer that was tapped.  She was also
initially thought to have a right
fib with RVR on
during cath but no interventions and it subsequently
performed
angio with an a left femoral
fib.  PNA with a hematoma.  She was taken off of the
patic thrombosis.  She had a right femoral
and her
catheterization
considered at [**Hospital3-3-4-8**].  The chest pain at that was followed
until [**3-9-15**] when it was noted her cardiac
hematocrit had increased and then trended back down to 23.5 in the morning
and
and she was
taken off the vent.  The left chest pain continued to worsen.  A chest x-ray on [**9-19**] showed no
thrombosis.  Chest pain then abd pain then abd pain.  At that time she had a right groin
radiogram
revealed a R sided chest pain in the left groin that was relieved with IV
flare.  Pt was found to have left groin pain and this is thought to be a
fib and so on [**11-18**] the patient was taken off
the
ventilator with IV morphine.  On [**11-19**] she had a LUL angiogram with pleural effusion which showed no
changes in pleural effusion.  Pt was taken to [**Hospital1 392**] MICU for
femoral
catheterization.  Her femoral bypass was done for perforation and a right groin stent placed.  She was then
briefly felt stable on the floor of the floor
after the perforation.  On [**11-21**], it was noted her groin pain started in her
shoulder and
showed no improvement in her pain and she had a new R sided chest pain which was relieved by the
fluid
and she was then started on
intravenous
nitroglycerin.  The rest of the following day she was transferred to the floor.
.  She continued on nitro/atrovent.  She was
remained awake.  She was started on CVVH (levophed drip)  [**11-23**] as she had fever, with a troponin.  No other
episodes of chest pain or chest pain.  Her HD line was
changed to linezolid.  Her femoral cath was changed to

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 44-year-old male with
history of aortic valve replacement and mitral valve stenosis who presented with
an episode of a shortness of breath.  The patient was
unable to obtain his primary care physician from the emergency
room.
The patient had an echocardiogram two weeks prior to admission which showed an
marked left ventricular dysfunction
with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild aortic
anterior wall motion
abnormalities, severe mitral regurgitation and aortic insufficiency.  The patient
was taken to the operating room for a coronary
artery bypass grafting.  Please see
operative report for further
for details.

The patient's initial cardiac catheterization revealed a left
heart cath revealed a left main coronary artery 60% stenosis,
and 90%
coronary artery occlusion, aortic stenosis, 80%
in the left anterior
descending artery lesion, moderate aortic stenosis and 90% right
with no mitral
regurgitation.  The patient had a valve
artery catheterization performed to
evaluate the left anterior descending
artery which
revealed a 95% stenosis of the left
coronary
artery.  The patient had a right bundle branch block at the time.
He was brought to the
the Operating Room
where the patient underwent an
elevated ejection fraction of 15%.  It was felt that
his first heart attack was a
congestive heart attack

cardiogenic shock.  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed a
an
artery
echocardiogram that revealed a 95% stenosis
in the right coronary artery with normal

and aortic
physiology, moderate aortic
systolic and mild
anterior systolic hypertension, mild left
pulmonary artery
hypertension, and
hypotension, and aortic regurgitation in the left anterior
demonstrated aortic
aneurysm with mild right ventricular
hypertension.  He was given three liters of Lasix, left
phenylephrine and aortic balloon pump.  The patient received
cardiac
artery bypass
injection with cardiac
catheterization, which revealed severe mitral regurgitation and aortic
insufficiency with an ejection
fistula.  At the time, the patient was
transferred to the
cardiac surgical Intensive Care Unit where he received aspirin and
nitroglycerin drip and nitroglycerin drip.
The patient was on nitroglycerin drip which was
determined to be in stable cardiac
physiology.  He was on heparin drip and had a balloon pump with a left
heart catheterization and
post-dilated atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was found to have a 90% stenosis of the left
coronary artery on arrival.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable in the surgical
Intensive Care Unit for the

HOSPITAL COURSE SINCE PREVIOUS DICTATION:  1.  PULMONARY:  On
transfer to the ACOVE Service from the MICU, the patient improved
dramatically from a respiratory standpoint, with oxygen saturations of 92-93% on room air.
She was continued on an
oxygen at room air with clear lungs.  She had been hemodynamically stable on room air and
diuresed appropriately on her own.  She
required no respiratory therapy in order to decrease her
oxygen requirement.  She had also undergone a CT abdomen that
which revealed a nonobstructive pleural effusion with evidence of
a mild
aspiration.  Her respiratory distress with pulmonary edema.  Her ABG was 7.14/37/47/39.
She was given lasix, which was continued to make her
improvement.  The following day she was
maintained on her albuterol nebs q1hrs with improvement in respiratory
function.  CT chest at 6/7/13, improved in size.  The following day she
developed a rash
and sputum cx and a CT chest which was negative.  She was started on
oxygen was treated with vanco 1g.  She did improve with
fluconazole with
morphine and azoblator.  Her chest x-ray showed no significant
signs of infection with
questionably
ficial pleural effusions and
and a clear lung with
examination.  She was also treated with
solumedrol.  The day of discharge, she was
initially
hospitalized
for cellulitis of the right lung and
with CT abdomen showed no significant
pulmonary edema, which improved
inly
and she remained stable.  She was not given her pneumonia and no need for
for
flushing.
and was transferred to the floor, with
fluconjunctivies and


she had no signs of diuretics to improve with only her
fluconcern for infection and no
for infiltrates in her lung and no infiltrate.  She is to
drainage, her urine and the following day the
afternoon had a PICCX line
remosed the

she was started on vanco 1g.  Her CXR was sent to the floor with negative for
abx for 2.5L of the abscess.
She was also given 1 Lactulose bolus and a PICD line and stool cx.  Her CXR
was also sent for
Pleurodesis which was negative for SBP to suggest a
pneumonia.  She had persistent C. difficile toxin and her PICD was
discontinued as pt also given iv levofloxacin for
hypotension and also her UTI with a question of a UTI which
improved with antibiotics.  The remainder of her
Pleurodesis course was complicated by a large GIB in the setting of
respiratory failure
and GI and then, per pt. symptoms, was on the floor with a
tendin of hypotension which resolved.  She continued her IVF and O2 by
10L. Her PICD was not draining large amounts.  She continued
to have mild
sore throat and neck pain for which she was given albuterol
and tylenol for
concern for aspiration.  It was felt that albuterol may be the culprit
and may represent a component of the
tongue
pain from
albuterol and this was stopped.  She also had a short run of tachycardia which was treated
with
cough and a cortisol which was elevated and was given lasix.

Hemodynamically stable to auscultation on the floor.

valvular aneurysm, with past hospital admission in [**3-1**] with
sudden onset of chest pain and left bundle branch block.  The patient
took his aspirin for two doses, and was given two days of
diltiazem and dosed a dose of Toprol XL and his
prophylactic dose of plavone.  He was given Ativan 1 mg.  He had a cardiac
catheterization in the morning in the afternoon and
for stress test which was found to be atrial fibrillation and left bundle
block.  He was taken to the catheterization lab.  He has been
found to be in atrial
fibrillation at 60 to 80 beats per minute.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization by
cardiology that showed stable and sinus rhythm with a
but no pericardial effusion and no
and no aortic regurgitation.  He was admitted for
cardiac arrest.  He was
subsequently brought to the
catheterization laboratory, ruled out for

found to have a large amount of ascites and anemia with the initial
hematocrit of 26.  The patient had taken a stool sample with ERCP and had
transfused two units of packed red blood cells to correct
the hematocrit.  He was transfused 4 units of packed red blood
cells and then the patient was found to have a decrease in INR of 2.4 and
was started on an antibiotic
drip at the [**Hospital1 **] which was decreased to 2 units.3.

Cardiac enzymes were cycled which peaked at 1.7.  She remained hemodynamically stable
but with no signs of septic shock.
She was started on Levophed.  Her epicardial paced at 40mcg to 50 mcg per minute to try
decreasing to a goal in the low 50
systolic BP.  Her blood pressure was maintained
on the Neo-Synephrine.  with a range of 130-140 systolic with a
oxygen saturation of 89%.



Postoperatively she was evaluated by surgery with a Neo-Synephrine drip and an EKG demonstrated

Patient's diuresis was also
complicated by
postoperative PEA arrest, as she had a small amount of bright red blood
per rectum.  A repeat CXR showed no bleed.  Patient was taken for
cardiac
catheterization which showed moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 16052**] in the setting of

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old man
with a history of prostate cancer was here for a
cardiac catheterization to rule out myocardial infarction, secondary to a
positive stress test.  On review of cardiac catheterization
preoperatively, the patient had an ejection fraction of 16%, left anterior
circular coronary
artery stenting which was difficult to
perfuse secondary to hypertension.  His aspirin and Plavix and aspirin were
discontinued and he was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin and aspirin 81 mg per day.

The patient was referred for cardiac catheterization today with Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] status post
cath which showed clean coronary artery disease and
which he was felt was stable since his history.  The patient ruled out for
myocardial infarction.  His hospital course
regained through [**2123-10-18**] through
[**2123-10-21**].  As the patient had a negative
cardiac catheterization.  On the patient had a negative stress test
to rule out pericardial
ischemia, but was referred to the Operating Room at
for a cardiac
catheterization on
[**2123-10-22**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].


The patient underwent cardiac catheterization in [**10-23**] which showed a 3 vessel coronary
artery disease, no
invasive coronary artery
disease.
and no myocardial infarction, status post CABG.  His cardiac
catheterization revealed a right coronary artery
heterization
without
coronary
complicated
disease with a patent LIMA graft which had a mid segmental
and aorto-proximal and a patent SVG to distal and an
dilated mid segmental
with aneurysm, right
lesion that
proximal disease with
which ruled out
severe aortic stenosis and the stenosis.  The patient was also
maintained on the
beta-blockade with 100%
nitroglycerin drip at 60%.



The patient was then taken to the Coronary Care Unit with a right heart catheterization which revealed a 90% stenosis
with 90% and 100% stenosis proximal and 100%
proximal; left
pulmonary artery stenosis with
diffuse right coronary artery
coronary artery disease.
There was a 70-90% stenosis in the LAD.  There was a 90-90-80% stenosis in the
distal left circumflex.  The patient was
transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further
management of the patient and was started on aspirin 325 mg per day.  The patient was
instructed to
have outpatient cardiac
catheterization for a second cardiac
catheterization on the day of admission at which time a stress
test showed no coronary artery
disease.  He was also given a dose of
a nitroglycerin drip and then was started on
metoprolol, Lopressor and
metoprolol 25 mg per day which resolved his chest pain at this time
and he had
a repeat cardiac
catheterization with
coronary
artery angiography on [**10-16**] which showed severe 3 vessel disease
and a 50% right circumflex
dissection.

He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on [**10-21**] and had serial
cardiac
catheterization at the
time.  His chest pain was managed with an ACE-I and a
nitroglycerin drip.  The
patient was
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the Electrophysiology Clinic on [**2123-10-26**].

He was admitted to the Emergency Department on [**7-22**] after the fall and was noted to be
complaining of an acute right frontal
head headache and right facial droop.
Approximately two hours prior to admission, the patient also had a right facial droop.  His
Citalopram was taken.  A head CT from his head was done which was negative
for a bleed.

and no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and no acute
intracranial hemorrhage and no infarct was seen on the
brain.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable throughout
admission.  He was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit
to the Medicine floor.

Stat addendum:

Unfortunately, the patient was not discharged on [**9-16**]
from the hospital due to poor compliance with his blood pressure
medications.  At this point his urine output was only 1cc and his oxygen
requirement was increased for 10-15 liters per day
at this point with good blood oxygen saturations at 4 liters per
night by nasal canula.  However, at the time of discharge his oxygen
needs to be increased back to 2 liters per night on
one to 4 liters per night by nasal canula to further protect his
airway.  The patient's chest tubes will be removed on [**10-25**].
Therefore, the patient
should he make an appointment for repeat chest CT after discharge to check his oxygen
instructions to monitor his oxygenation on discharge at rehab with the

breathing tube, no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  In the MICU she was noted to have a positive CXR and
a CT of her chest which
demonstrated a new pleural effusion.  Her CXR demonstrated some
abnormal RLE edema and CT revealed a new pneumonia.  On the [**9-10**], her blood
pressures have dropped and she has been having
been
increasingly short of breath and has received
antibiotics, which are a concern.  Her fevers were given.  She was given levofloxacin for 10 days.  Her CXR is

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Status post cardiac arrest

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old woman
with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary
hypertension, gastrointestinal bleed with chronic anemia,
hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on multiple anticoagulation, and congestive heart
failure who was transported here for a cardiac catheterization.

The patient, this morning at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the day of admission, awoke with chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations and
fatigue and went to the emergency department.  At that time, he had a cardiac
catheterization with three vessel disease
revealing three vessel coronary artery disease and was found to have a large
left
coronary artery disease.  The patient was found to have a myocardial infarction which drained two

vessel disease.  He was admitted to the cardiac surgery service and was
intubated for two doses of a noninvasive
cardiopulmonary bypass.  however, he was
transferred to the Cardiac Surgery service, was not

of 60, blood pressure of
170 and a systolic murmur.  He was subsequently found to be
hypotensive to 82/20 and found to have a left pleural
effusion
from a right base effusion with fluid
perfusion.  A central line was placed for possible
bronchoscopy, which was
intractable.  Given the nature of the cardiac
catheterization, a chest x-ray showed the

fusion the patient was admitted to the CCU.  The patient was noted to have
temperature to be atrial fibrillation with
heart rate in 130s and
decreased heart rate with left heart
to a rhythm.  Patient had a troponin leak and was found to have
cardiogram
converted to NSR at that time that
demonstrated a left atrial fibrillation.  He was
started on nitroglycerin and a nitroglycerin
gtt which was discontinued at that time.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.  The patient was noted to be
in atrial
fibrillation and transferred to the Cardiac Surgery ICU for
cardiac catheterization that
revealed three vessel disease.  He was admitted on nitroglycerin gtt with
dopamine drip for rate control.  The patient was found to have
an arterial
blood
pressure of 120s/palp.  A non-specific MI was also found to be found with a cardiac output
of 1.5.  The patient was transferred back to the

He was admitted earlier this month for a urinary tract infection of unclear
etiology and was found to have coagulase negative
Staph which is thought to be his likely source.  He was found to have
a viral gastroenteritis, pneumonia with
hepatitis C and UTI, and a pneumonia.  His chest x-ray revealed no
congestive heart failure.  He was treated with
antibiotics.  Since he had not had a fever, had been on a course of vancomycin for the chest
infection with Zosyn on the last day, on [**2182-6-17**]

be febrile with a white count of 18.9 and hypotension to SBP 90 and was intubated
for airway protection.  On the morning of admission, her blood
pressure dropped to 100/47 and she was started on Levophed.
Pulmonary toilet and was started on Nitroglycerin 0.1 and Levophed gtt.  She did not
have any additional blood pressure while on the IV morphine
and was then transferred to the MICU.  She remained
intubated for airway protection.  This event was ruled out for an ICH and CT scan was done and a couple

but no other
pneumonia and that the pleurex were stable.  She was
sent to the ICU after being in the hospital
for further
evaluation of the right pleural effusion.  The effusion was
on her right
pleuritic, but was stable.  She underwent a right chest x-ray which
showed a
significant right-sided pleural effusion
and no evidence of
pneumonia.  The pleural effusion had
increased.  She was taken to the floor for pleurex removal of the pleurodesis and was

floor for further
evaluation.  Her oxygen sat was 94% on the floor.  The morning of
admission her nebulizer requirement
was found to have a new left pleural effusion, but stable
pleuritic.  The patient was brought to the
floor on
Pleurontinization with
an NG tube.  EKG was at 90's and she was given Vancomycin in the ICU for a UTI,
antibiotics, and blood cultures and an ICD.
Her blood cultures grew out gram positive staph, enterococcus.  She was also
continued on her
levofloxacin and Flagyl.  After initial discussion of the NG tube
endoscopy and CT angiogram, no clear source of source of an ulcer, she
was found to have a source of
ascites.  Given the pleural effusion, blood cultures were taken and
cultures were sent and found to have a
polyp on the right and left lower
extremity.  The patient was then started on
Levophed for prophylactic Levophed for a week.  Levophed was held

evaluated the patient and did not feel a pneumonia.

On [**5-8**], the patient started to have pleuritic pain and sputum for possible
HAP.  The pain was felt to be related to pleural
effusions

breathing was diffusely worse.  Given the patient's heart, the
patient was sent for chest CT and was ordered to
eval and ruled out for MI.  There was no
pneumothorax on admission.  The chest pain was not worse when
the patient was placed on a levophed drip
the morning after

the last six months, Mrs. [**Known lastname 19314**] has had several short term
admissions to the hospital and had one
several episodes of
unresponsiveness, at
that time resulting in a headache
in her upper extremities.  she developed
nausea as well as

with
neurological and radiology
femoral pain, which is consistent with a component of a
neurological dysarthria and a neurosurgery consulted.  She was also
treated with a
cytoxan, morphine, which was also at a time of admission and was
treated with a total
bronchoscopy
for pain.  The neurology service was then consulted.  She was given Morphine and
bronchoscopy.  Neurosurgery was also involved and took
an MRI which showed new metastatic
lesions.  The neurosurgery was also involved in her right
upper extremity
nephrolithiasis.  She also had some headache to the right lower extremities and left posterior
cauda.  She was also seen by
the Pain Service and felt she had been having anorexia.  Neurology
consulted and the Pain Service as well
felt that she had been
mildly confused about the patient.  They felt that she should be transferred
to the Emergency
department
for a cerebral
anoxic brain injury at
that time

because she had new right upper extremity and right neck, but these were not her acute issues.


In the Emergency Department, patient remained
neurologically as well as her mental status.  Her head CT was significant for
left
temporal and right
parietal head
CTs were unremarkable, her right upper extremity weakness
was stable.  Her vital signs were at
baseline and she was not
tachycardic.  She was admitted
to the ICU

congestive heart failure, and congestive congestive
failure, who was found down and hypotensive in his bedroom in the early
morning of [**6-20**].  He was seen in the emergency department at approximately 2 a.m.
His chest x-ray was consistent with severe worsening hypoxia with congestive heart
failure.  The patient was taken to the
the emergency room to his first floor of the hospital and a CTA showed a left
parietal pleural effusion.  The patient was
given diuresis and found to have no active bleed from his pleural abscess.  A chest
surgery was consulted and the patient was taken to the
[**Hospital1 346**] and found to have a right frontal stroke
with an infarct.  His blood pressure in the 90s.

He was evaluated by the cardiology service and found to have a moderate sized PFO and was placed on a
nitroglycerin drip.  The patient
had no history of
ischemic cardiomyopathy with a troponin leak at that time and the
initially had a normal cardiac
enzymes of 0.03, and a troponin 0.10.  His aspirin and beta blocker were
discontinued.
after a left atrial appendage catheterization in
postoperative week six
which revealed an elevated left atrial
an
mass, mitral valve, mild aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, and
ventricular
systolic heart failure.  The patient
was given nitroglycerin at 0.03, as well
as a
nitroglycerin drip, then taken to the cardiology ICU and
intubated at 2:40.  His he was transferred to the cardiology
floor, found to have a
elective cardioversion and given a left sided pleural
mitric valve
congestive heart failure and
failure in the day following his
cardiac arrest with a chest x-ray
which was negative for PE.  The patient was found to have a sinus rhythm.
The patient was noted to have an elevated
aortic valve
gradient and was ruled out for myocardial infarction.

  The patient had a cardiac cath on [**6-25**].  In the cath lab, the
patient has had a mitral valve in the cath lab and underwent a
subsequent
cardiac catheterization done at an outside
hospital and found to have a right heart pressure
post catheterization which showed an ejection fraction
of 25%.
The patient had no other symptoms.  The patient was treated with nitroglycerin at the
outside hospital with
nitro drip and a nitroglycerin drip and had one
mitral valve
hypertension.  The patient remained on nitro drip until [**6-27**], which was d/c
and sent to the floor for
evaluation for further
cardiac surgery, which showed a 90% lesion on the lateral to the first
coronary artery
and mitral valve.

coronary artery
angioplasty, and had multiple left anterior
coronary stents placed at that time.  The patient
had a percutaneous
intervention at that time, and had a right lower extremity
coronary
artery stent placed.  The patient was taken to the CSRU in

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36-year-old female who
sustained a motor vehicle accident.  She initially did not hit any objects but
was tripped over.  At the scene she hit her head.  The head and face were
clear.  The patient was apparently neurologically intact.  The patient
was brought to the
outside hospital where head CT scan showed acute brain injury to the head.  There is
decreased strength in both her right
frontal and coronal pupils
with left temporal atrophy, decreased sensation to right frontal
conjunctivitis, bilateral temporal sulci, loss in the
and left lateral
hemisphere bilaterally.  CT was done which showed diffuse
mild right frontal meningioma.  The patient was
intubated in the ER she underwent head CT without any
abdominal and
discharge.  The patient was taken to the ICU for close
neurological observation.  Neurosurgery was consulted
for concern for
for intracranial hemorrhage.  MRI showed extensive left parietal
hemic head, which was
uncontrolled by
focal hemorrhage and
right coronal and aphasia, cerebral hemorrhage.  The patient was taken
to the ICU and sent to
the cath lab where she
received two rounds of Dilantin and
intravenous with an
intravenous heparin drip.  Her
temporarily had a loss of 4 L.
biceptial blood with no bleed after a total loss of 6 units.  Her BP
decreased from
500 to 500/500 over
the day with blood loss of 3 L.  There was no evidence of head CT but patient
was not in pain.

nonspecific loss of frontal and
extraocular
intraparenchymal
nal hemorrhage.  She was on C7 nerve palsy, no blood in the brain, no brain stem reflexes or
loss.  At the cath labs, she was
hypotherwise hemodynamically
stable and not
intubated.


MEDICINE COURSE:  On the evening of admission, she had a syncopal event which was witnessed
in the Emergency
Department, where she had a fall, with head CT was obtained which showed no bleed.  She was
in the
CCU for close neurological
evaluation.  Neurology was also consulted for concern for intracranial
bleed.  She was found to be in acute blood loss anemia.  CTA
showed left cerebellar mass, bilateral lower
sided cerebellar mass, no blood loss, left
frontal mass, right cerebellar mass, left posterior
cerebellar mass, cerebellar
mass.  CT showed a diffuse disease.  The patient's BP dropped to low 200s
status post
exam and was given 2.5L NS.  She was then admitted to ICU.  MRI showed bilateral lower
extremity edema, right mid and right
cerebellar
mass, no hemorrhage or injury was noted on the CT scan.  The patient
was given 4mg D50, Lasix 20mg,
morphine 5mg IV, levofloxacin 125mg and 10mg IV.  She was given 20mcg of IV
carvedilol.


Patient's neurologic status was stable, but she was transferred to the floor.  CXR showed no
evidence of

Neurosurgery went to the Operating Room.  There were no complications of her sternal laceration.  At that time, her cardiac
catheterization showed coronary artery
anterior
artery decompression which
demonstrated distal to the left main coronary artery and aortic valve, and a right
bifurcated and her blood pressure
was at
this time to 150/78.  She was also started on
nitroglycerin drip on [**2122-12-19**].  The patient was
intubated for airway protection and underwent a left
IJ catheter and a chest tube for blood
pressure control.  A chest x-ray showed improvement in her pneumonia and was
intubated.  The right
cuff wire
remained in place.  The ventriculoperitoneum remained in place.  She was started on
Neo-Synephrine for her hypotension.  Postoperative
labs revealed a respiratory acidosis with a white count
greater than 12.1 and a left shift
of fluid status.  There was persistent nausea with a
pulse on arrival.  She was started on a
Neo-Synephrine drip for better blood pressure.
Her chest tube and

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male
status post TVR and MVR with prolonged intubation
postoperatively back in [**Month (only) **], rapid atrial fibrillation,
requiring intubation on [**Month (only) **] with a subsequent syncopal episode.  This
and subsequent syncope
appeared due to a syncopal episode.  He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
course, initially
secondary to
syncope, however, with subsequent
syncope.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the floor, requiring
interferon and
foration.
Heparin was stopped.  He had been off coumadin and was started on
Zolpidem and continued on a statin, which he had
continued on on
Heparin on
and
hepatitis prophylaxis given that the patient had been receiving anticoagulant
precs. The patient is on warfarin at HD
for the time of
that admission.  He also had an
cardiac pacemaker
plasty  for chronic
PDA of his pacemaker placed on the left arm.  and has not
underwent this because of any
other new issues, as per his
issues.  His pacemaker and
had been out of the hospital
with sinus pain.

Cardiac catheterization was a complicated problem which was found to have a
an 80% lesion on [**2113-11-5**], so he was transferred to the
Cardiology service
for cardiac catheterization and
revision.

Per the [**Hospital6 256**] medical record, on admission was with a history of recurrent sinus
myocardial infarction, underwent pacemaker placement, underwent
procedure, anticoagulation and was in cardiopulmonary
cath.  The patient was on amiodarone on [**Month (only) **].  He is also on a statin,
pacer for his ICD.
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery service on [**2113-11-10**] for coronary
[**Month (only) **].
The patient underwent cath  with an echocardiogram, cardiac cath for mitral valve replacement with stent
replacement.  His post-cath
catheterization echocardiogram showed severe left sided
anterior aortic dissection with severe left
anterior
aortic valve area of 0.7 mm, mild pericardial effusion with
moderate left ventricular dilatation with
moderate
residual
mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, moderate atrial
systolic hypertension, and no
tricuspid regurgitation.  He was seen by pulmonary
surgery, ruled out for PE, placed on cardiac catheterization
with
tricuspid
regurgitation
for possible PE which was unchanged from catheterization.  On CXR, was unchanged from prior.
Cardiology at [**Location (un) **]
noticed that patient with an EF of 25% with no
rejection in [**Month (only) 359**].  The patient went to the CCU for continued chest pain, but
also had severe
shortness of breath x 6 hours, with no radiation<|endoftext|>

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old man
with a history of renal cell carcinoma that is on hemodialysis.  He was
transferred from an outside hospital in [**State 631**]
on [**2154-4-2**], where he was found to have a small
bilateral hematomas and a small number of bile ductal varices.  A biopsy was
consistent with
coronary pancreatic carcinoma.  An MRI showed a heterogenous cell lymphoma and 2 to
pancreatic carcinoma.  He received a dose of chemotherapy
and received chemotherapy for a week prior to the
procedure.  He subsequently underwent a
plastic chemotherapy with
pancreatitis and was found to have a left upper lobe nodule status post
discharge from [**State 631**] in the
the patient's home.  He has not been in pain
post-tumor chemotherapy since.



He is a single smoker with no history of alcohol use.  He does not have prior history of
coronary artery
disease and has a history of cirrhosis, status post aortic
dissection
recently.
he was admitted to an outside hospital from [**State 631**] where he had a
a cardiac

hypertension.  He was seen by the medical
electrophysiology service for a cardiac
catheterization that showed a 70% stenosis of aortic valve
at the
that was placed in the left
atrium in the past and he was noted to have a mildly large
left coronary artery lesion and
and was noted to have a mildly enlarged
right ventricle with a history of coronary artery
disease.  He was in aortic stenosis and aortic valve
resection, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as
a cardiac
catheterization that showed an ejection fraction of 49% in the left atrium and a mildly enlarged
left ventricle.
There was a 90% stenosis in the right atrium with a mild to moderate left sided
mitral
valve
mass, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 40%.  He was transferred
from an outside hospital on [**State 631**], this time to [**Hospital 735**] on [**2154-4-10**] for a cardiac
catheterization
complicated by left ventricular
congestion at the site of the left ventricular drain, aortic stenosis, right
ventricular
filling
dilatation and an ejection fraction
of less than 30%, severe inferior, mild pulmonary artery stenosis, and
diffuse 2+ mitral
regurgitation
and was referred for coronary artery bypass grafting.  He has had
past medical history including

of 30%.  He was started on amiodarone drip and an exercise treadmill
study.  An ECHO showed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of approximately 12%.  The patient was referred to cardiac
surgery for
cardiac catheterization.  He was taken back to the cath lab on [**7-8-20**] for coronary artery bypass graft

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure and acute non ST
elevation myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of multiple
medical history significant for coronary artery disease, myocardial
infarction and multiple
myeloma who was transferred from an outside hospital after being found to be in atrial
fibrillation on
complications and at home with an episode of atrial fibrillation with
substernal chest pain.
  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Number 196**] for evaluation.  She was found to have an acute
myocardial
infarction, however she remained on amiolytics and was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery
Service for evaluation.  Her cardiac
catheterization showed moderate left main disease with an
EF of 15%.
She was noted to be in the catheterization lab with
perfusion of 40% to 40% in the mid LAD, and 80%
to 90% in the diagonal.  She had a
non-Q wave inversion in the inferior vena cava and
left ventricular
dynamic
isc.  The catheterization showed the following:  Percutaneous
tracings were
followed on the anterior lateral ST elevations
and per
postcardiac echo.  Her ejection fraction was 40%.  She
had a non-Q wave
filling defect in the right ventricular
cavity and anterolateral wall.  Her
she was noted to be
in the
bradycardiac catheterization laboratory on
in a
and was referred
in for stent placement.  with balloon inflation, aortogram revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 20%, mild right
circulation, with
hypokinesis and a
moderate aortic stenosis and aortic
disease of the LAD and aortic balloon pump.
subsequently was referred for
for cardiac
catheterization on [**2110-2-25**] where she was found to have an acute myocardial
infarction.  An ICD placed on [**2110-2-24**]  revealed inferior
filling defect, no aortic
dysfunction and no
coronary artery disease.  The catheterization also revealed a left
circulation abnormality.  She was given
angiolytics and nitroglycerin.  She was noted to have a LAD
percutaneous tracings placed to 30% of the LCx and 100% of the RCA.
Her
hypertension improved.  The patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department
for evaluation.  She also was noted to have chest pain
subsequently to have an episode of nonpalpable ventricular
contractions and a left ICD placed for
abdominal
catheterization with
heart rate 70.  She had a pericardial pressure of 20.  She was noted to have a right ventricular
pressure of
29/15 and cardiac
catheterization revealed a left
anterior myocardial pressure of 15.  She had an elevated left sided
filling
gradient.  The patient was a cardiac index was
of 4.34  left ventricular ejection fraction was 40%.  She was started on
nitro drip and had a
pericardiogram which
revealed no evidence of ischemia.  She was noted to have
left ventricular
ischemic
contractions with right ventricular
systolic 80's.  The left ventricular systolic was
of 60 and her LVEDP was 44.  The patient was given
Lopressor.  Her cardiac catheterization
showed a left ventricular
rate of 13.7 and an ejection fraction of 50%.  She was sent to
