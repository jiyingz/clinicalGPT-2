HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    This is a 60-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease with a history of non-Q wave MI, status post
stent to the right coronary artery in [**2183-7-10**].  He was originally
admitted to the cardiac
catheterization lab after having a hematocrit of 36.4, however, over the ensuing days

worsening chest x-ray with worsening ST depressions on electrocardiograms.  Also, the
his hematocrit went down to 23.  He was ruled out for
myocardial infarction.
and transferred back to the floor.  On chest x-ray, it was noted that the patient had
had an
left lower lobe infiltrate, but no acute
stent to the left main
infarct and was noted.  His initial chest x-ray after the chest x-ray showed some clot

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65-year-old
female with diabetes and hypertension who developed chest
pain on the morning of admission and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization with angiography.
Please see catheterization report for details.  In summary, the patient had a left main

artery stenosis, a 50% lesion in the diagonal, an 80% mid 80%

The patient
was brought emergently to the catheterization laboratory at the [**Hospital1 346**]
where a stress echo demonstrated
diffusing disease with a left ventricular anterolateral and
reversible perfusion defect.  The patient was
taken to the

female who has a past medical history of congestive heart failure and
nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a history of multiple myeloma status post AV
nodal ablation in [**2092**] at [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital and cardiac catheterization at that hospital revealed
two-vessel disease with a small anterior apical hypokinesis, coronary artery
disease.  She had previously been on
echocardiography with
echocardiogram showing a moderate to severe aortic stenosis at [**Hospital1 **]
where she had stent restenosis in her LAD at the origin of the
and distal right
circumflex artery.  There were four previous

diagnosed with a right renal mass after presenting with frank
hematuria.  A CT scan done at [**Hospital6 1760**] revealed a renal mass and the
patient underwent a radical cystectomy, nephrectomy and bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy for this right renal mass.  The patient presented on
