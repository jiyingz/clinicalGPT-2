Service:  VASCULAR

ADDENDUM:  The initial discharge summary was dictated on
[**2199-3-19**].  This is an addendum dictated on [**2199-3-22**].

The patient initially was admitted to the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit.  His hematocrit and white blood cell count
remained stable and did not require any more transfusion.

He did require one unit of packed red blood cells for
hematocrit and decreased renal function, which was felt to
be due to his sepsis.  At that time the
patient was started on a course of
gentamycin.  It was felt the patient
developed the sepsis from his
initial sepsis on the sepsis protocol.


After starting the gentamycin, the patient developed an
intrahepatic process called
sepsis with a change in his MS.  It was felt this
was secondary to
intraoperative
sepsis.  This was treated with three to four units
of packed red blood cells and two units
of fresh
frozen plasma.  On [**2199-3-23**] the patient
developed a
concerning hematocrit drop to 22.2.  This was felt to
be secondary to
intravenous fluids
and he was put on
broad spectrum
antibiotics.  He was therefore maintained on the broad
antibiotics
which were
and his
intraoperative antibiotics.


Due to the drop in his hematocrit, a CT scan was obtained on [**2199-3-24**],
which showed no
changes
and he has been started on
Levaquin.  The patient's
white blood cell count has
remained
stable.  The
and the patient's white blood cell count continues to
be
stable.
and remained stable on
Levaquin for
the remainder of his
of his
stay.




As stated before, a CT of the abdomen was obtained on [**2199-3-27**] which
showed no change.  The CT of the
abdomen
was obtained on
[**2199-3-26**].  This is a CT scan
showing the patient was stable.



The patient's CT revealed the patient had multiple deep vein thrombosis deep
veins in

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 20 year old
gentleman with a history of type 1 diabetes, hepatitis C
cirrhosis, recurrent urosepsis, who presents with a
complicated medical course.  He presented on [**2176-1-22**] with
headaches and neck stiffness.  At that time, his liver function
tests were noted to be elevated.  He underwent an EEG.  There was
no seizure activity on EEG.  On the morning of admission,
the patient underwent cardiac
echocardiogram which revealed severe mitral
regurgitation and a large pericardial effusion.  This
was thought to be related to his
chronic urosepsis which was felt to be
secondary to hepatitis C.  On
admission the patient had two events of
chest pain and headache.

Cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 55%.
His left atrial size was 2+.  Left
Abdominal CT, chest,
abdominal x-ray and blood cultures
included no

throughout his hospitalization.  He was ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  His anti-hypertensives (atenolol,
valsartan, Imdur, HCTZ) were held for his renal failure.
The patient was ruled out for anemia and his hematocrit was
relatively stable throughout his
hospitalization.  He was continued on his aspirin,
carvedilol, amiodarone and metoprolol
during his stay in the CCU.

Abnormal vaginal bleeding


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 yo male with h/o prostate cancer admitted from an OSH for
abnormal vaginal bleeding, and was found to have a hematocrit of 26
25 which was attributed to large volume of bleeding.
He was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 6 for a tagged RBC
scan and found to have an extensive right sided
transverse colonic
hematoma, and a large amount of blood noted within the rectum,
likely
although there was no blood noted during the scan itself.
However, he did have a
colonscopy which showed a significant
amount of hemorrhagic
contrast.  Pt was not initially given any
further blood, so he was admitted to the floor
for
further management.  Per OSH records, pt was last seen in
clinic
with a rectal
appointment and was in good condition when the bleeding was noticed.

is notable for an angioplasty of the diagonal branch of the ramus in
[**2128-1-7**] for chronic right ventricular systolic dysfunction.  He
has a known hiatal hernia and has a history of transient
hypoglycemia.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital **] Clinic
on [**2137-7-1**] and his INR was 8.9 and his
initial CXR showed bilateral fluffy
opoint opacities that were concerning for
bilateral pulmonary edema versus infiltrate.  He was
started on
Levofloxacin 750 mg q day x1 and Flagyl 500 mg q8.  He
had a blood gas that was
7.39/85/43.  He was brought to the ER, where
intravenous Lopressor and
doses of Clindamycin, Vancomycin, Flagyl and
levofloxacin were
were given with a positive troponin level
and he was
transferred to the CCU.  In the CCU, the patient was in
sinus rhythm.



The patient had a chest x-ray on [**2137-7-1**] that was suggestive of a right
middle lobe

to be cyanotic with a white blood cell count of 17.8 and a
blood pressure of 82/34 with a heart rate of
85, respirations 18 and oxygen saturation of
100%.  He was initially treated
with intravenous fluids and antibiotics but
ultimately was given
nebulized Solu-Medrol and azithromycin.  On hospital day number three, he

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
woman with a history of hypertension, asthma, and
depression who is admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
one day of back pain and dyspnea.  The patient
describes the pain as severe and constant and is able to walk
several blocks, but it is also associated with
palpitations.  The patient had no prior back pain of
intracranial pathology.  She has never been on steroid
taper for hypertension and no
antabuse history.  She also reports no recent fever or
episodes of cough.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was transferred from the Emergency Room on
[**2177-3-3-1**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for evaluation of her acute
episodes of
epigastric pain.  Initially, it was felt that the patient had
epigastric pain due to some
ischemic esophageal
an.  A computed tomography angiogram was performed to rule out
any
dysmotility.  Ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.
Subsequent EKG done in the Emergency
Room showed ST elevations in the inferior
leads with T wave
inversions in V3 and V4 through V6.  It was not
thought that these were
secondary to
ischemia.  Patient was started on an insulin drip, and
following
up EKGs was very
conetic.  The patient was
afterwards ruled out with enzymes
negative and she was sent to the
Medical
Intensive Care Unit for
further
management.

improvement
in O2
sats.
The patient underwent CTA showing no acute findings, but
bipap and nitro, with a drop in
BPs from 89% on
NRB
to 74. His ABG was still

transaminitis with liver abnormalities, elevated
liver function tests and a rise in her bilirubin.  The
patient was
initially started on a Heparin drip.  Heparin was then
stopped and the patient was switched to
Diflucan given the elevated
liver function tests.  The patient also
had rising total bilirubin after
discontinuation of the Diflucan.  She was
and this was felt to be a change
from her baseline of less than

Stat addendum:

Unfortunately, the patient was not discharged on [**9-16**]
because of lack of progress in his care.  No definite
complications of hemodialysis on a daily basis, but
drainage was delayed for a few days because of the lack of
improvement in hematocrit or mental status.  It became apparent
that he likely had a hematocrit drop secondary to demand
ischemia.  On [**9-17**], his catheter tip was sent for analysis

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old man with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
complaints of increasing cough, dyspnea and decreased intakes
starting approximately four days ago.  He was found to be
hypoxic with an O2 saturation of 63% on 2 liters of nasal
cannula, as well as an elevation in his white blood cell
count from 8.6 to 15.0.  He was therefore sent for a
chest x-ray, which revealed bilateral pneumonia.  This
morning, he became increasingly short of breath,
unable to speak, but arousable with mild
diaphoresis.  The patient was subsequently
obtunded with an oxygen saturation of 65%.  His
chest x-ray at that time was read as
consistent with
bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage and evidence of bilateral
acute pulmonary edema, with no evidence
of acute cardiac
distress.  He was subsequently
emergent and intubated for airway protection.
Subsequently, he was
transferred to the Emergency
Department for further evaluation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40 year-old
lady with a long history of intractable epilepsy beginning in
[**2073**] secondary to her seizure disorder and subsequent
severe cerebral palsy.  She has undergone multiple
transient inotropic and vasodilator treatments over the past
years.  She was in her usual state of health, in her usual state
until approximately four days prior to admission when she started
experiencing epileptiform episodes of
intraventricular activity that would wake her from sleep.  It was
initially worse in the evening and progressed to
occipitiation at times of severe
disorientation and inability to sleep, at times leading to
confusion and/or anxiety.  The symptoms were
progressing with
occasional generalized
anxiety and generalized shaking which progressed to
occipated with rest and then seizure.  She
upon further
exacerbation became acutely more
fatigued.  She had been
experiencing generalized weakness and
anxiety, and was therefore brought to the Emergency
Department.

The seizure was characterized as right frontal in the frontal areas
and was of the frontal
witness
report.  The patient's seizure was a generalized seizure
with a slow,
nonconcurrent, left homonymous
hemianephyic
epine that was also without
epileptiform
features.  The patient's EEG showed that this seizure was a
slow repetitive
generalized
encephalic seizure with left to right
frontal
deteriorbital
flaggings, and an encephalopathic
background and it did not
reveal any
associated
seizure
features.  The patient had a CT of the head done and was
pronounced to be a
without
focal at that time.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension, ventricular tachycardia with
cardiac arrest.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and put on
a cardiac catheterization on [**2200-5-11**] which revealed a 50%
mid left anterior descending artery stenosis, 90% right coronary
artery stenosis, 100% left circumflex stenosis and total
occlusion of the left anterior descending artery.  This
artery was stented and the patient remained
intubated.  In addition the patient had an
angiogram done on [**2200-5-13**] which
showed 60% proximal left anterior descending
artery stenosis and 100% proximal right
coronary artery stenosis and 100% occlusion of the
left anterior
descending
coronary artery of the patient's mid left
circumflex.  Because the patient had a
mid stent of this
coronary artery it was decided to attempt
catheterization of the
the left
circumflex.


The patient remained intubated and was started on
intravenous dopamine.  The patient's hematocrit

History of Present Illness:

for liver transplant secondary to ETOH withdrawal and
pancytopenia.  Pt was noted to be in an "ethanol

.
Pt has had extensive liver workup in the past including staging as follows:
[**2137-4-28**]: RUQ US with 1 cm liver mass with
perfusion scan suspicious for acute hepatic
encephalopathy and
metastatic features, now liver
metastases. No clear evidence for acute lobar
infar infar infarct; 2.7 cm cystic lesion in the mid-to-lower
pole
body
with no clear evidence for metastases.
(CT was unrevealing). In discussion with pt's PCP, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
[**Name (STitle) **], the decision is to hold off on
any
follow-up MRI/PET imaging to assess for new or worsening liver lesions.  He
and wife
also feel it is best
to perform TTE to
rule out acute myeloma.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 28982**] did not feel that
an ultrasound would
be helpful.  Pt was sent for PPD

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dysphagia, urinary retention, and failure
to thrive.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81-year-old man
who underwent a CABG in [**2193**] with a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous
vein graft to OM, saphenous vein graft to PLV, and a saphenous
vein graft to the PDA.  After the graft to OM was widely
patent, he presented to [**Hospital3 **] Center with
diarrhea and abdominal pain.  He was noted to have a
significant drop in his blood pressures, and the patient
was noted to have an estimated blood loss of 500 cc.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] for
further
evaluation, admission to [**Hospital1 190**], and possible intervention.  Patient was noted to have a
supra-aortic balloon inserted in the
right upper quadrant on [**2193-4-3**], and was
treated with 20 IV Lasix.
with a good response.  Patient was noted to have persistent
abdominal pain, but no
decreased urine output.
On [**2193-4-6**], the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which was
which demonstrated a large mass in the
right upper lobe
of the liver
and the patient was transferred to the operating room for liver
transplant.


At the OSH the patient was found to have a dilated right atrium and a large pericardial
effusion, in addition to a
tectic right
pericardial
sepsis in the setting of
hypotension.  Given
hypotension and acute kidney injury, it was thought that
the patient's
decreased blood
pressure was secondary
to his renal failure.
Patient's blood pressure was treated with
IV lasix and
heparin, and the pt
was transferred
for further
management of his
of
decreased bloodpressure.



The patient was admitted to the ICU and on [**4-18**] received a pericardiocentesis,
which was
converted to normal sinus rhythm
with a blood loss of 500cc.  The patient was
given 2U of FFP, 4 liters of IV fluids, and 2U of
fluids.

Patient was taken to the

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 51-year-old woman with
a history of a recent stroke, asthma, insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, history of tobacco abuse, who
presents with weakness and confusion.  Her blood pressure was
reportedly in the 80s systolic, and a temperature of 100.0.
Electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block, anteroseptal
ST depression.  The patient has a pacemaker in place.

The patient has a baseline chronic cough and nasal congestion.  It is
unclear how long she has been on the
pacemaker.  However, based on her discharge
summary, it may be several years.  The patient also
has a history of recurrent
cough, which is now chronic.  It is felt to be
unlikely that this
could be secondary to asthma.  The patient denies
headache, shortness of breath, chest pain.  Per
report, the patient is oriented
times three.

The patient was in her usual state of health until approximately one
week prior to
admission, when she developed
diarrhea and urinary tract
infection.  On admission, the patient was
started on
Zosyn and Levaquin.  She had a history of
cholesterol elevated in
the 500s.  She had a stress test in [**2131**].  However, her
electrocardiogram
showed new ST depressions on her
first
set of
enzymes.  The patient had a repeat cardiac
echocardiogram with EF of less than 30%.
Cardiac
echroenterogram
showed an ejection fraction of 25%,
normal biventricular
dular function, and new anteroapical


and septal wall motion
depressions consistent with an ischemic
deficile.  The patient
and

were consulted for
anemia workup and an infectious
