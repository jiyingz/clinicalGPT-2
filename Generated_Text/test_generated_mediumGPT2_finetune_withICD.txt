1.  PULMONARY:  The patient continued to improve from a
pulmonary standpoint.  The patient had a repeat CT scan that showed
small bilateral pleural effusions.  It was thought that the
effusion was secondary to aggressive pulmonary toilet
associated with her multiple respiratory
distressors.  In the Emergency Department, the patient was
given Lasix with significant
improvement in her respiratory status.  On [**4-20**], the
patient was changed to
Dilaudid for pain.  She received two to three
additional doses of intravenous Lasix.
Her pain dramatically
improved.


The patient was started on standing Lasix for increased pulmonary function and was
switched to a standing Lasix dose on
on [**4-24**].  The patient's O2 was weaned down on

Room with severe intracerebral hemorrhage and possible
intracranial bleed.  He had been admitted from [**11-17**] to [**11-18**]
for increasing lethargy, weakness and was found to
have a subarachnoid hemorrhage by MRI at that time.  He had
previously undergone clipping of
the subarachnoid hemorrhage which he tolerated well,
then underwent a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for
hemorrhage.  He was seen by the
Neurosurgical Service, who was uncomfortable with
extraction of the
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  His course was further
complicated by bilateral
subdural hematomas, left greater on the left and right
posterior as well as possible
subarachnoid
blegia.  His course was also complicated by at times by
resistent chest pain
which was new.  On [**Month/Day/Year (2) **] surgery was called to evaluate
the patient and
on [**2116-2-3-6**] he was brought to the operating room for
emergent placement of a
ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
and placement of a feeding
feed for feeding tube.  He tolerated the procedure well and
was then
