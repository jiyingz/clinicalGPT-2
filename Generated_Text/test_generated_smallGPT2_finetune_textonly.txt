[**2117-11-8**] after undergoing cardiac catheterization for
coronary artery bypass graft times three with a LIMA to the LAD graft to the
SVG graft to the obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to the OM1 and a
Saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending.  The patient
was noted to be diaphoretic and short of breath and was intubated for
airway protection on the morning of
[**11-11-12**].  He was transferred to the MICU intubated on the morning of [**11-13**] for
catheterization.  He underwent right coronary artery bypass
graft times three.  Angioplasty and stenting times three to left circumflex

patient was taken to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  His initial
head CT revealed a diffuse intraparenchymal, subacromial
hemorrhage with left subcranial hemorrhage with right frontal hypodensity.  There
was also left ventriculose in the right cerebellum and an area of
hemorrhage.

He was admitted for close neurologic observation.  Neurosurgery recommended to hold the lidocaine which he had
atropine for at that time which was then restarted at 15 mg every
hours.  The patient was monitored
thereafter.  He had a brief episode of seizure, no electroencephalogram which showed

Intensive Care Unit.  The following morning,
the Neurology team noticed at 10:30 am the patient
had left gaze deviation.  He was thought to be having
epileptic head on the same
shaking difficulty that had occured with the previous night with

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS/HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was
an 89-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis who presents to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit with two days of severe nausea and vomiting.  Her
symptoms were thought to be multifactorial due to acute tubular necrosis
as well as end-stage renal disease on HD since admission with poor renal
function.  Her symptoms worsened with increasing
diuresis.  The differential diagnosis was multifactorial,
including the above, atypical pneumonia, pneumonia,
sepsis, myelodysplastic encephalopathy, acute tubular necrosis, sepsis,
asthrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia, and acute blood loss anemia.

history of atrial fibrillation and had been on anticoagulation for the
past three years for this reason since [**Month (only) **] of [**2074**], [**2152**], and [**2155**].  She was
hemodynamically stable and transferred to the CCU for further management.  The
Cardiac catheterization showed an ejection fraction of 55% with severe
stenosis of the left main and left anterior descending, 80%, an ejection
fraction of 20%, mild systolic
hypertension, moderate anterior wall motion disease, and ejection fraction of 75% to
85%, mild mitral regurgitation
and moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension and moderate aortic stenosis, moderate
aortic regurgitation.  The patient had left first MI in [**2152**].  She
She was on aspirin, metoprolol, Plavix, and Lisinopril until she was
diagnosed with congestive heart failure

for PMHx syncope. He has been feeling increasingly SOB recently. He
developed SOB today for which he was sent to the ED. Of note, he has had similar episode
in the past. His last episode was 5yrs ago and not prior to that and was described as
not new. The SOB improved with standing
hydralazine but not in the last 2 days so no changes in his dose.

. He has been using his 2.9mg of albuterol 1-3mg at home and had been doing so for 4x. He reports that he has
decreased PO intake
recently. At home and when the CP started this morning his CP started yesterday. He was also had BP up to 90s and

In the morning of [**11-11**], she was again called out to the floor and she went for a coronary
catheterization, a left anterior descending and a right coronary
arterial artery stent was placed and a left
stent was
placed which was
patent.  She denied any palpitations at rest and no chest pain, however, she was told
to follow up with the cath team.  She denied
any
nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.  She does complain of chest pain and had nausea

hypoxia and
respiratory distress. He was treated with Cipro and given nebs.  He was then brought back to
[**Hospital1 18**] for repeat chest CT with evidence of pleural
effusion. His exam remained stable
from that day and he was diaphoretic and the following morning. He was
referred to the floor.  On the morning of
[**2157-3-30**] an echo revealed EF>55%. He was noted to have increased
opacity of the apices at the base of the apices and mid LAD but no
signs of
pulmonary edema. He was found to have worsened PFO with pulmonary edema. He was

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted for elective
cardiac catheterization and catheterization on [**2162-2-12**].  He underwent
catheterization on [**2162-2-14**] to assess coronary artery calcification
and cardiac output.  On catheterization, the patient was found to have a
total occlusion of 1-mm of the left circumflex.  The left main artery was
occluded.  The left anterior descending was severely diseased
and the right coronary artery had severe
obstruction with moderate
collaterals.  The left circumflex was totally occluded proximally with an area of
occlusion in the mid vessel and an oblique
coronary
occlusion.  He was admitted emergently for angiogram.  The patient was given a balloon angioplasty times
3 with a balloon pump at that was successful
repair
and was brought to the catheterization lab.  The patient had total occlusion of 2
of 3 of the two overlapping obtuse marginal and
stents.  Catheterization showed severe aneurysmal
disease.  Catheterization was performed in the catheter
system, which showed 3+ mitral regurgitation,
and the left circumflex had
inferior hypokinesis with some small right and severe
coronary
stenosis.  In total 2 of the left circumflex arteries was totally
occluded.  The left anterior
descending artery had a 30-mm of the right coronary
artery which had mild
disease but was totally occluded, and
patent diagonal
occlusion.  Patient was started on
heparin and atrial fibrillation.  He was diuresed approximately
15mm of the obtuse marginal
and the left
ocerved right coronary artery which was aneurysm.

collaterals
which was patent to
the obtuse marginal.
Catheterization was performed with 2 of the left circumflex.  The

50% ostial occlusion and he tolerated a cross clamp.  The
patient
was followed by the interventional cardiology service, who
re-do
performed a CABG times one and they did not feel
that he had any residual stenosis from that procedure.  He had no
significant coronary disease
and they felt that the cath that revealed
was not an [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8367**] that was patent in the

end-stage renal disease.  He has undergone a right nephrectomy and
resection of his aortic valve and is admitted status post the pericardiocentesis.


HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:
1.  ICHEULA:  Patient presented to the Intensive Care Unit on [**11-9**] with a large amount
of bloody stool.  He was intubated and sedated and was started on the pericardiocentesis
at 15 hours prior to admission.  He also had evidence of
right flank hematoma and was found to have multiple large amount of bleeding in
at that time.  An infectious work up was done to look for
undertempt to identify a source of his
bleeding, but they were unable to find.  At that time, a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative.  On the patient is
and was rehydrated and did not have any new bleed.  The
on [**11-10**] developed another hematoma on the left hand in the
subdural and was started on heparin drip after CT Surgery.  This
showed a large hematoma.  CT surgery was done on [**11-12**] which was
negative.  On [**11-16**] a small hematoma was found on right arm and [**11-18**] a
pericardiocentesis was done at that time and
he was put back on tube feeds.  The patient was
intubated and brought to the CSRU post surgery.  He was hemodynamically
stable post
intubation.  The patient was continued to be weaned off pressors and
intubated.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and
sedation was placed.  At that time, he was put back on a central
line and
cardiopulmonary
catheter at 10-20.  on POD 1.  The Swan-Ganz was then advanced to a CVP at 28.  The Swan-Ganz was weaned
off to the
pacer.  He did not have any intraepisodes of
hemodynamic compromise given the Swan-Ganz catheter and the chest tube.  A Swan-Ganz was then
discontinued and
placed back on the right
cardiopulmonary catheter with the right at 18 to
21 in the
catheter which was placed on the right.  He was put back on the left at 18 in
catheter and was taken off

discontinued
because he did not have any evidence of worsening in perfusion.  Cardiology was consulted
after the left
subcutaneous
Heparin gtt was taken off on [**11-21**] because the right arm was placed again.  The Swan-Ganz was
discontinued and
then the right subcutaneous Heparin gtt
removed.  On the evening of [**11-18**], the right CP was brought out again and the patient
had a new hematoma.  A Swan-Ganz
drained for 10 days and the patient underwent

percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left renal artery
for graft rejection.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2194-10-3**], where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement, mitral valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft x 2 and aortic
valve replacement. She underwent mitral valve
annuloplasty, Aortic Valve Replacement with Plavix, mitral annuloplasty ring,
saprosthetic valve annuloplasty ring, mitral valve replacement with
stent. On [**2194-10-6**], [**2194-10-3**] she developed recurrent

setting of a polyuria.  The patient was referred by his
primary care physician to [**Hospital1 18**] who felt the patient had been
noted to have a polyuria on admission and was placed on a heparin gtt.  The patient
was seen by Dr.[**Name (NI) 1481**] consult who felt he may have a polyuria in the

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
morbidly obese female with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who presents with fevers.  The patient has had multiple
intubations in the past and is unable to tolerate nasal cannula
oxygen.

Fever at home has been associated with shortness of breath and cough for one
week.  The patient was originally admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in
the operating room for a bronchoscopy and
nasogastric lavage.  In the procedure, the patient had a bronchoscopy with
a question of an obstruction causing the effusion
and an an intubation at which time a fluid
collection was noted.  The patient was given one unit of packed red blood cells
and one unit of fresh frozen plasma.  She was also had an
episode of atrial fibrillation.


The patient also had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on the day before
admitted,
at which she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit on a dose of Coumadin with
antin.  She received two units of packed red blood cells to keep her
weight, but
consequently developed what was thought to be atrial
fibrillation and

initially taken to the
the cardiac catheterization and
lab in which the patient was rate controlled,
and was converted to sinus rhythm.

postoperatively the patient was transferred
to the
cardiac
fusion unit.  She was found to have left
right subclavian and left chest tube placed and was subsequently
started on

paracentesis for atrial fibrillation.


At the time of transfer in the CCU the patient was intubation she was started on
coumadin.  Her catheterization at that time showed a
ejection fraction
of 12%, pulmonary edema and a pericardial effusion, a pericardial
effusion at
25%.  The patient was then on Amiodarone and Integrilin.  Her
Intraop heparin drip was converted to drip.  The patient was transferred to the
cardiac
intensive care unit
in the catheterization and the left chest tube was
removed.  She was on milrinone and diuresis for fluid
restrictive indices, weaned off her
metoprolol and diuresis.  The patient was placed on Neo with
Milrinone.  Her milrinone was titrated to
2/0.5 and Milrinone was weaned off.  The patient was continued on
postoperative
Amiodarone.  She was seen by surgery for a R.PICC and R.I. popliteal bypass.  She was
extubated without
complications.  The patient was then seen by
surgery for a left subclavian.  On postoperative day
one, the
patient was transferred
to the CCU for observation in stable condition.  She was
monitored
on the floor and taken off of Milrinone and the
procedure was noted to be
stable.  She continued to be diuresed, her blood pressure
persisted.  She was transferred from the
CCU to the floor on postoperative day one.<|endoftext|>

Flagyl and ceftriaxone.  He was sent to the [**Hospital1 69**] for a question of
cardioversion.  There he went into atrial fibrillation.  He had been on Coumadin with rate down to
70-80s, atrial fibrillation for several days, started on a beta-blocker and
dopamine.  A chest x-ray showed a right
sided pleural effusion.  In the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 69**] with a right pleural

to the
CSRU for a Swan Ganz catheterization on the 24.


The Swan catheterization revealed an ejection fraction of 25-30%, left ventricular ejection
fraction 50%.  The patient had a
tachycardia.  He was given a dose of aspirin.  He was started on 2 liters of
fluid with 1.5 liters of D50.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 36733**] was a 72-year-old
male with multiple medical issues including coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2105**],
hypertension, and a question of diabetes mellitus who was admitted
for workup of anemia and hyperglycemia complicated by acute renal
failure secondary to pancreatic failure.  The patient had recently
admitted from [**Date range (1) 36734**] for congestive heart failure and
respiratory distress thought secondary to acute tubular necrosis
thought secondary to acute tubular necrosis of liver,
bilateral pleural effusions.  The patient had been admitted in

a.  The patient subsequently was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
management of a renal failure
on [**Date range (1) 36734**] and was treated for a presumed
hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident.
The patient developed a diabetic ketoacidosis and was treated with amiodarone at that time
secondary to
hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident with subsequent
cardiomyopathy and
and then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
admission for management of hypoglycemia.  The patient
was transferred with history of
hypertensive emergency, renal failure and at that time;
hypoxic
respiratory distress, at that time.  The patient was
initially treated with intravenous
amiodarone and was taken emergently to the
the cardiac catheterization lab where
ad with
nitroglycerin, ligation of his right upper quadrant, cardiac
catheterization, and
biliary stent.  The patient then underwent
cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 3645**] of this year
which
with a left subclavian line was placed.  There was a patent right
stent placed.  He was found to have a 30%
pulmonary artery stenosis, and
stenosis.   There was a non-insulin dependent
disease requiring
nephrotic
diabetes mellitus and on admission.  He was found to be in a non-compliance
with his
with his insulin pump,
and was found to have a dilated cardiomyopathy
and was started on a dose of Lasix drip.  The patient was
initially on
hydration with an insulin pump at
after the catheterization.  The patient was noted to have an
hypotension to 80 to 100 and
110s
at that was attributed to atrial
fibrillation thought secondary to the [**Date range 36735**].  The patient
had
an intraventricular conduction delay and then responded to the use of a
diltiazem drip,
nepartussine, and then was taken off the drip and then back to the
cardiac cath
catheterization lab because of acute renal failure, however a CT scan of the
abdominal
was ordered.

Per report, the patient was hypotensive at that time, also complaining of
shortness of breath on the floor, which resolved and was
thought secondary to
non-bloody abdominal pain,
non-hepatic congestion, and poor
peripancreatic fat stranding.  The patient's electrolytes were
remarkable for a pH of 8.1, a pCO2 of 32, a pO2 of 58, a pO2 of 88, a pO2 of 81 with
abnormal
magnesium of 1.8, a P2 of 46 with a pCO2 of 63.  Chest x-ray with a question of a small
pulmonary
edema.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2-2119-12-2**] where a right IJ central line was
placed in
anterior pericardial space.  The patient was intubated.  There was right
femoral
pacer wire in place, as well as a hemodialysis catheter in the pericardium.
The
patient was given
intravenous Lasix and intravenous Lopressor with an insulin drip. <|endoftext|>

pancreatic insufficiency.  The patient presented with a 24 hour
history of chest pain radiating down his chest and shortness of breath
while getting his medications and this occurred several
days later in his clinic, most likely the result of a combination of
poor oral intake,
deconditioning, and
respiratory insufficiency.

infarction in [**2170**] at which point she was initially
started on fluconazole and then changed to
prednisone.  She also underwent a recent myocardial infarction at that
point.  She underwent an intra-aortic balloon pump for the repair
of her AV fistula in [**2178-11-2**].  The patient
received IVIG therapy.  At that point, however, she was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate
requiring initiation of Coumadin.

She has had numerous admissions in the last few months for hypotension and, prior to the present
events, she was admitted to the Neurology service at [**Hospital3 2558**]
in the past several months.  She was found on [**9-14**] to have a right sided cerebral
lobe stroke

The patient had been on an IV heparin drip for the last couple of days, then on [**2176-12-9**] was
noted to have a drop in white blood cell and a
hematocrit that
was found to be 19 with a repeat head CT which was 21 and 21 on [**2176-12-11**].  Neurology
found her to have a
right facial bleed and there was a new subdural hemorrhage and she was started on
heparin drip.  She had been
initiated on subdural heparin and sent for head CT.  She was taken to the
operating room,
there was no new stroke and her status was noted to be stable.  She was
transferred to the ICU

complaining of diarrhea for which she gave herself 40 mg po b.i.d. and did not think
her symptoms were due to food or fluids.  At that time, nausea and vomiting
became worse.  Her vomiting was followed by a [**Name2 (NI) **] at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**9-20**] to rule out an acute gastrointestinal bleed.


SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted on [**9-21**].  During the previous admission, she had three vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  She
and her previous admission her angiogram showed an occlusion of the left
main, left anterior descending
artery graft and an ejection fraction of 18%, moderate
aortic stenosis and
pericardial stenosis, right coronary artery aneurysm and aortic root
angiopathic graft.  The patient was admitted to the
cardiothoracic intensive care unit for
an for an angiogram and a mechanical
perforation of her left anterior descending artery aneurysm on [**9-17**],
an occlusion of her
left circumflex artery aneurysm, and
decreased filling of her left circumflex artery aneurysm with
an graft.  She
underwent three vessel coronary artery
bypass graft in the cardiac catheterization

dilated aneurysm aortic arch aortic and aortic stenosis of the
circumflex graft.  She was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where it was noted
she had a 90% stenosis, severe an aortic stenosis in the
left
coronary artery with a left main
coronary artery aneurysm and 2+ mitral annulus
and a 90% stenosis at the left circumflex aorta.  She was taken in for a
catheterization
which revealed a 60% mid circumflex, 70% stenosis in the obtuse marginal and 90%
stenosis in the left
 circumflex.  She was taken for left anterior descending
artery aneurysm angioplasty and left circumflex graft angioplasty
and
angioplasty, but
she did not have
significant coronary artery disease.  She underwent an an aneurysm angioplasty of the left
circumflex and aortic
anastomosis that showed a 30% aneurysm.  She was
subsequently transferred to the

a history of pulmonary embolism, status post right carotid
endarterectomy, status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2117-1-8**], with a
recent admission to [**Hospital1 346**], who presented to the Emergency Department on [**2118-6-24**]
with acute onset of shortness of breath.

She has shortness of breath at rest for the past week, accompanied by exertional dyspnea on exertion.  She
took an aspirin for five days while in the Emergency
Department.  The patient denies chest pain.
In the Emergency Department, she was found to have low-grade fevers up to 103, chest
pressure up to 140/110.  She was noted to have troponin of 14.  She was found to be in the
hyperventilatory in the Emergency
Department and an EKG showed a CK of 24, with a troponin of 19.  Her ECG showed normal.  The
she received a Nitro drip for suspected to be
congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy in
with an CK of 3.  She underwent Cardiac catheterization
times three with aortic valve to obtain
normalization with left main coronary artery to obtain
perfusion.  Cardiac catheterization was
complicated by a left ventricular
pressure of 33.  Cardiac catheterization revealed a normal

and she was referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory who was found to be in
hypotensive and was found
emporal
hypertensive to be on a nitroglycerin drip in the
and had an electrocardiogram that was in sinus.  She was found to be in a
hypotension of 20 to
32 and was started on a nitro drip.  The chest pain was associated
with
hypoxia and was treated with 40 to 70.  Her cardiologist was called.  She was started on a
nitroglycerin drip and nitroglycerin
patch.  Patient was in acute shortness of breath
consistently in the setting of chest pain.  She was
diuresed with a chest x-ray which was unchanged from her
baseline in size.
She was transferred back to the SICU post
cardiac catheterization.  She underwent cardiac catheterization
catheterization on
[**2118-6-25**], where she was found to have an
arterial
anterior wall aneurysm 60, mild mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery aneurysm at a
40% which was unchanged from
baseline.  Her troponin was found to be in the 100-110's.  She
had a TEE-MIBI which was stable.  Her electrocardiogram showed left main and
LV aortic depressions.
She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] in a right heart cath where she was found to have a 95% LMCA with no
disease and
coronary
arterial pressures

having dinner, and he went into a car and then struck the left front window.  His
headache was sudden, not frontal, and not associated with any SOB or
epigastric pain.

He is now admitted for evaluation of a left frontoparietal stroke and head trauma.  He had been
on anticoagulation at the outside
hospital with Coumadin for the last 2 days.  He had been in the hospital for several days for
an acute stroke at the outside hospital.
The patient reports that he did not have a headache prior to this stroke,
the previous episodes were
which had been [**9-26**] and [**2168-9-27**]
and have been non-invasively, anemic prior to the fall and [**2168-10-2**].

He denies any loss of consciousness, abdominal pain or fevers, orthopnea, chest pain, palpitations,
diaphoresis, PND, myalgias, lightheadedness, dizziness, dizziness,
hemoptysis, hemoptysis, or bright red blood per rectum.  The patient
presented to the ED at the outside hospital

[**Hospital1 **] and underwent CT scan of the head, which
showed an acute, severe left frontal cerebral edema and
associated
fusion and hemorrhage
asias.  CT head was negative at that time.  The patient then underwent a
right neck fusion
[**Hospital1 **]
MRI with the same CT scan for concern of a right sided
cerebral effusion.  at that he
developed a right MCA infarct of 5 cm, then right neck stroke and
at 10 days
ago.  he was placed on a left.  He received a
hemodialysis at that was noted to have
severe headache for
that same CT scan
in the week before on [**9-26**].  CT in his brain biopsy
negative for infarct.  The head at [**Hospital1 **]

showed large LN stroke [**2168-9-25**] in 3 months, also [**9-26**] and [**10-26**]
complaining that he did not
see any significant change in the stroke
at the ICD.  He reported that the first stroke was
"ashen appearing but a small neck headache.  The neurology
showed no
dysarthria.  He was noted to be alert and oriented.  Headache, visual acuity
and muscle strength
improvement was good.  The headache was not the same since the previous, the sensation
was old.  The headaches were new.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male
status post TVR and MVR with prolonged intubation
postoperatively back in [**Month (only) **], rapid atrial fibrillation,
nephropathy, hyperlipidemia.  He is also a smoker.  At
home, he is taking 30 mg a day of B12, vitamin D and is currently
taking 40 mg a day of Folate.  He is taking 80 mg a day of vitamin D.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] in [**Month (only) 547**], who had the following problem
diagnostic:

s/p right subclavian AV fistula removal and right popliteal AV fistula placement with persistent left sided
shortness of breath
with worsening cough and increased secretions.  The patient was treated with
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.  He now had
cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest and was subsequently given
aspirin.  He was found to have severe aortic stenosis
of right main pulmonary artery
obstruction.  An at the outside hospital course, his
electrocardiogram from the outside hospital and a chest x-ray
showed no
diagnostic embolism.
and was ruled out for an evolving right heart failure.  His catheterization was
performed at [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2113-11-5**], and showed
atrial fibrillation
at 86.
to 86 with left axis deviation, right ventricular pacer placed in [**Month (only) 547**] and right
ventricular ejection
fraction 80%.  He was treated for atrial fibrillation, was treated
with 3 units of pRBC, received aspirin and
am/[**Hospital1 **] and then was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for
cardiac catheterization.  He was placed on aspirin 325 mg.  on [**Hospital1 **] in
prior cardiac arrest.
[**2113-11-6**] at [**Hospital1 188**] where he was noted to have a right sided
pleural effusion at [**Hospital1 18**] with
pleurigulopathy and a right sided pleural effusion
which increased, was placed on [**11-6**] to 1 cm above the right
pleura.  Cardiac catheterization
with aorta
dissection that was repaired with
with a 20%
compressions, a mechanical aortic valve.
He was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which was complicated
by
pulmonary artery occlusion
and was placed on a PEA arrest that was noted to have a
faint pleurodesis with a mild pulmonic
embolus.  EKG at that time showed a left axis
and intervals in atrial enlargement,
pulmonic, severe left ventricular
hypertrophy and severe aortic regurgitation with ventricular bigeminy.
.  Left chest radiograph was also
unremarkable.  He had a CXR was performed, which showed right IJ
intestines in the lateral portion of the RCA and no
diffuse
effusion,
and he had a CXR [**10-19**] with no pulmonary edema.  There was a left axillary wedge
pneumothorax.  Chest films showed evidence of CABG,
cardiomegaly.  Cardiac cath showed a small right pleural effusion,
left lower lobe
collapse.  Chest x-ray showed
cardiomegaly.  He was in a sinus rhythm.  He was given a lasix 40mg IV
Lasix 40 and an Lopressor and a total pCO2 of 24.  He was
eventually
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cath at that time found to have
pulmonary artery aneurysm
and was in aortic rupture.  The procedure was
complicated by anasarca, right
pulmonic valve, right pleural effusion, with left
subdural
bleeding of
left atrial and right inferior ventricle which was diffusely
diffusely dilated.  He
was treated with CVL drip<|endoftext|>

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old male
patient with known heart murmur with bibasilar crackles on
exertion radiating to his lungs and to his abdomen.  The
patient presented with dyspnea on exertion for two weeks.  The
patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy, who
evaluated him by Emergency Room Medicine who felt he had significant aortic
stenosis with minimal aortic regurgitation and an aortic valve
annulopopneumothorax.

The patient had two short cardiac catheterizations in the past one and one day with stent placement
secondary to worsening dyspnea on exertion times
three weeks.  These episodes
were associated with hypotension for which he responded to fluid resusitation and then
and finally to pressure
therapy for which the patient responded to 80 mg of
nitroglycerin.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 749**]

of cardiac surgery at this point.  On [**2163-8-2**], her
diagnosis of hypertension and aortic stenosis
was confirmed with CT angiography.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery:

1.  Coronary artery bypass graft times three with a stent of the right internal mammary artery to the right coronary
artery
originally
and
removed from the left
anterior tibial artery at that
origin.  The patient has been on nitroglycerin since then but has had intermittent
episodes of
right sided chest pain.  This

was found to have an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction
(62 percent) with a calculated right ventricular ejection
fraction of approximately 15 to 20 percent.  Patient had been treated with IV
therapy with beta blocker and atorvastatin, and a total
prolonged antibiotic course.  She has had an electrocardiogram
which revealed an irregular rhythm and was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Medical Intensive Care Unit for elective coronary
arteriogram.  Cardiology consult service was called on [**2164-8-18**].  Cardiac surgery

dilated coronary artery
occlusion, and
stenosis of the left circumflex.  A bare metal stent was placed in
circumflex.  The patient underwent
coronary
angiogram
on [**2164-9-1-1**] where she was found to have 3 to 5 to 5 mm
gradient in her left circumflex.  The left circumflex was

coronary
disease of the left circumflex.  The rest of the
circumflex was occluded.  Right coronary artery occluded at the
proximal end with an ejection fraction of
20-25%.  Cardiac surgery was called
from the CCU following the case.  Her left anterior descending artery
artery at
catheterization was
found to be 30% in mid to distal anterior descending
coronary artery a.  She had an ejection fraction of 50%
and an aortic valve area of 0.8 mm on the
left atrial end.  Her exercise in the CCU was performed
after the event was as described
above, it was felt she did well with no arrhythmias.  She was
referred to cardiac surgery
service.  She underwent mitral valve replacement at the time and was
given three to four minutes of
pacing to
